# Overview of the repository
In this repository, I've collected all the projects I worked on during my B.Sc. in Statistics at the University of Florence and my M.Sc. in Statistical Sciences at the University of Padua. 
The majority of these codes were written for specific exams and they were not corrected by the Professor. 

In this file, I'll show a quick overview of all the projects uploaded to the repository. In addition to this file, for each folder, there is a "README.md", which contains the following information:
1. Brief introduction - the reason why I worked on this project, the Professor's evaluation on the exam (although the projects contributed only partially to the grade) and some information about the course.
2. Overview - a very brief overview of the data and the task of the project.
3. Main concepts - the main concepts and tools introduced during the analysis.
4. Project structure - a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis process.
5. (Enhancements and Learnings - since most of the projects presented are quite dated, this section contains eventual improvements I would introduce with the knowledge I've gained throughout time).

### 1: Credit card fraud detection - 2021 (Python)
This is a group project I worked on with two of my former classmates for the exam of "Fundamentals of Information Systems" attended the first semester of the first year of my Master's degree. The course provided insights on both the algorithmic theory and practical basics of informatics (for instance, data structure) on Python and was held by Professors Di Nunzio and Silvello.

The goal was to identify fraudulent credit card transactions on a dataset containing 31 features collected over 284 807 observations, 492 of which are frauds. The task was, therefore, a classification problem on unbalanced data. In order to do that, we began the analysis with EDA, data cleaning, and feature selection and then applied a Logistic Regression and an XGBoost model to make the predictions.

The project received a score of 3 out of 4 points during the evaluation.

### 2: Bivariate time series analysis: dynamic OLS - 2020 (R studio)
I realized this analysis with the help of Professor Magrini of the University of Florence as part of my B.Sc. thesis: "Dynamic Linear Model for the estimation of Dynamic Causal Effects in the Economic Field" in 2020.

The goal was to study the unidirectional relationship from advertisement expenses to sales, analyzing the case study of Lydia Pinkham's company. 
In order to do that, I applied some tools for time series analysis, for instance, ADF tests and QLR tests, and applied a Dynamic Linear model.

The thesis received a score of 3 out of 3 points during the evaluation.

### 3: Social demography: number of children and educational level - 2020 (STATA)
This is a project I worked on for the exam "Social Demography" attended during the last year of my B.Sc. at the University of Florence.

The goal was to study the effect of women's education on the number of children at the end of the reproductive age, net of some control and intervening variables. The analysis was conducted on an EVS (European Social Values) dataset referred to the years 1981-2008.

In this project, I based my analysis on social demographic theories and applied simple but effective tools (graphical analysis and linear regression models) to reply to the research question.

The exam, which was composed of an oral exam and the project, received a score of 28 out of 30 points during the evaluation.

### 4: Univariate financial time series analysis: - 2020 (R studio)


### 5: Univariate economic time serie analysis: - 2020
