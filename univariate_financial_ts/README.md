# Univariate financial time series analysis:Alibaba Group Holding Limited case study
This project contains a univariate financial time series analysis that aims to study the trend over time of the daily closing prices of the financial title “Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA)” during the period 19/09/2014 – 31/01/2020. The aim of this project was to predict the future trend of the stock.

I realized this analysis as part of a group project carried on by me and my former classmate Dai Xuanye in 2020 for the "Economic Statistics" course, held by Professor Cipollini and provided by the Statistics Department of the University of Florence.

The exam, which was composed of an oral exam and a project, was graded as 30/30 by the Professor.
