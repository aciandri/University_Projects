# Bivariate time series analysis
This project contains a bivariate time series analysis that aims to study the relationship between advertisement expenses and sales. In particular, it's an analysis of the Pinkham case study.

I realized this analysis with the help of Professor Magrini of the University of Florence as part of my B.Sc. thesis: "Dynamic Linear Model for the estimation of Dynamic Causal Effects in the Economic Field" in 2020.

The thesis received a score of 3 out of 3 points during the evaluation.

## Overview
For this project, the Professor provided me with a dataset containing Lydia Pinkham's company's advertisement expenses and sales data from 1907 to 1960. In this analysis, the advertisement expenses were considered as an exogenous factor, as per the already existing literature.

From this analysis, it resulted that there exists a relevant causal effect of the advertisement on the sales net of legislative changes, which has been accounted for through a dummy that identifies the prohibition era. The long-term effect of a one percent change in the advertisement expenses on sales is about +0.7%. More precisely, net of legislative changes, the effect of a 1% increment of the exogenous factor has a decreasing time trend (+0.364% the same year, +0.174% at the first lag, +0.126% at the third trend).
