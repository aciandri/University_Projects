# Overview of the repository
In this repository, I've collected all the projects I worked on during my B.Sc. in Statistics at the University of Florence and my M.Sc. in Statistical Sciences at the University of Padua. 
The majority of these codes were written for specific exams and they were not corrected by the Professor. 

In this file, I'll show a quick overview of all the projects uploaded to the repository. In addition to this file, for each folder, there is a "README.dm", which contains the following information:
1. Brief introduction - the reason why I worked on this project, the Professor's evaluation on the exam (although the projects contributed only partially to the grade) and some information about the course.
2. Overview - a very brief overview of the data and the task of the project.
3. Main concepts - the main concepts and tools introduced during the analysis.
4. Project structure - a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis process.
5. (Corrections - since most of the projects presented are quite dated, this section contains eventual improvements I would introduce now).

### 1: Credit card fraud detection - 2021 (Python)
This is a group project I worked on with two of my classmates for the exam of "Fundamentals of Information Systems" attended the first semester of the first year of the Master's degree. 

The goal was to identify fraudulent credit card transactions on a dataset containing 31 features collected over 284 807 observations, 492 of which are frauds. The task was, therefore, a classification problem on unbalanced data.

The project received a score of 3 out of 4 points during the evaluation.
